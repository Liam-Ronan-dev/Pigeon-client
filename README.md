# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

# Notes:

1. On edit, create, and delete - when the user is returned to all pigeons, the pigeon still shows up. Need to have the state updated in a useEffect. Look into changing the useAPI hook
2. Look at races again - positions, totalParticipants
3. Create types for data
4. Fix date formats
5. check former border colour
6. Turn search into a component
